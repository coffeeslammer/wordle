# About

this is one of the first projects I took on my own learning javascript.

## Issues

- I need to add a "you loose" with the word displayed
- old project so I still need to remember what else :p

## Notes

I made this a while ago when first learning javascript. I also made it in python. I am learning how to use git so decided to see how comfortable I am at adding and pushing old projects of mine onto github.

### idea

an idea came when I played it to have a hint option because I suck at this game. The problem is with that idea I think I would have to turn my over 2000 words array I downloaded from somewhere into objects O.o
